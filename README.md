## Features

Video Library mobile application displaying movies and their descriptions using API TMDB.

The navigation bar will let you choose between 3 views:

*Search* view: You can display a page with a selected movie and its datas and add it to your favourites. You can also share your favourite movie with your friend using a specific share button according the OS.

*Favourite movies* view: You can see your favourite movie list.

*Latest movies* view: You can see the latest movies available on theatre.

Extra features:

- You can add an avatar in the application using your camera or your photo-gallery

- Works on Android and IOS

- Data is persistent

## How to launch
(Android only, read the [doc](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for IOS/Mac )

First you will need [Expo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=fr) on your Android device

**With Expo / Node.js server (application-crna branch)**:

- `npm install -g expo-cli` (should not be nessessary if you clone this repo)

- `npm start`

- Open the url provided by the server then scan the QR code with the Expo app on your Android device

**With React Native (application-ejection)**:

Follow these instructions: [Install Android development environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#1-install-android-studio)

- `react-native run-android` (if you meet problems during building try this: `npm install react-native-gesture-handler@1.0.5`)

If there are too many problem during building restart from scratch:

- `react-native init MyVideoLibrary`
- Copy these files/folders from this repo: App.js / Animations / API / Components / Helpers / Images / Navigation / Store
- Run:

~~~
npm install --save react-navigation
npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler
npm install --save moment
npm install --save numeral
npm install --save redux
npm install --save react-redux
npm install
react-native link
~~~

- `react-native run-android`

## Libraries used:

Moment

`npm install --save moment`

Numeral

`npm install --save numeral`

Navigation

`npm install --save react-navigation`

Gesture Handler

`npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler`

Image Picker

~~~~
npm install --save react-native-image-picker

react-native link
~~~~

Redux

~~~~
npm install --save redux

npm install --save react-redux

npm install --save redux-persist

~~~~

Redux is used to manage general states (here for favourites)

- The user clicks the "Favourites" button in the *FilmDetail* component.

- We create an action with the type "TOGGLE_FAVORITE" the film displayed as value.

- We move the action to the Redux store.

- The Redux store dispatches the action to a reducer able to manage the action with type *"TOGGLE_FAVORITE"*.

- The reducer *toggleFavorite* will receive the action and will change the state of your application.

- Redux will detect a change in its store in the list of favorite movies, and will send the new list to the components that suscribe to its changes.

- The *FilmDetail* component receives the list of new movies, maps it to its props, and launches the update lifecycle to re-render itself.

### API: request your token

Connect and suscribe to [API TMDB (The Movie DataBase)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and ask for a token/api key (v3 auth).

Rename **API/TMDBApi.exemple.js** in **API/TMDBApi.js** and replace `<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>` by the token provided by API TMDB.
